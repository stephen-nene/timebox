1. Pomodoro
- 

Based on the provided information and the code snippets in the open file, it seems like you are working on a time management tool that uses the Pomodoro technique. The tool is designed to help users optimize their daily schedules by incorporating two-block Pomodoros, buffer periods, and designated time slots for various tasks.

Here's a summary of the tasks you've outlined for the Pomodoro time management tool:

1. **Define Core Features & Use Cases**
   - Weekly task entry system
   - Assigning deliverables to each week
   - Timeboxing model for daily task management
   - Brain dump section for unstructured thoughts
   - Task prioritization (Top 3 daily tasks)
   - Task breakdown for structured execution

2. **Create Wireframes & User Flow**
   - Weekly view (shows all tasks/deliverables)
   - Daily view (shows selected tasks & timeboxing)
   - UI for brain dump → priority tasks → structured breakdown

3. **Backend Development (REST/GraphQL)**
   - `Users` table (if multi-user system)
   - `Weeks` table (links to users, stores deliverables)
   - `Tasks` table (links to weeks, contains priority, breakdown, and completion status)
   - `Timeboxes` table (links to tasks, stores time allocations per day)
   - API Development (REST/GraphQL)

4. **Frontend Development**
   - Develop Weekly View
   - Develop Daily View & Timeboxing
   - Implement Task Breakdown UI

5. **Testing & HR-Approval**
   - Run Internal Testing (Unit & Integration)
   - Security & Compliance Checks
   - Prepare HR-Approvals & Documentation

6. **Deployment & Iteration**
   - Deploy to Staging & Gather Feedback
   - Deploy to Production & Monitor Usage

To help you further, I'll provide some code snippets and suggestions for each phase of the project.

**Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering**

You've already outlined the core features and use cases for the Pomodoro time management tool. To further refine your requirements, consider creating wireframes and user flows for the weekly and daily views. This will help you visualize the user interface and workflow, making it easier to identify any potential issues or improvements.

**Phase 2: Backend Development**

For the backend development, you'll need to design the database schema and implement the API endpoints. Here's a sample code snippet for creating a new week with deliverables using Express and MongoDB:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const WeekSchema = require('./schemas/Week');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const newWeek = new WeekSchema({
      deliverables: req.body.deliverables,
      user: req.user._id
    });

    await newWeek.save();
    res.status(201).json(newWeek);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

**Phase 3: Frontend Development**

For the frontend development, you'll need to create the user interface and implement the interactions. Here's a sample code snippet for creating a daily view using React:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { selectTasks } from './tasksSlice';

const DailyView = () => {
  const tasks = useSelector(selectTasks);

  return (
    <div>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <div key={task.id}>
          <h3>{task.title}</h3>
          <p>{task.description}</p>
          <button>Start Pomodoro</button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DailyView;
```

**Phase 4: Testing & HR-Approval**

For the testing phase, you'll need to write unit and integration tests for your API endpoints and user interface components. Here's a sample code snippet for a unit test using Jest and Supertest:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app');

describe('Weeks API', () => {
  it('should create a new week with deliverables', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/weeks')
      .send({ deliverables: ['Task 1', 'Task 2'] });

    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.deliverables).toEqual(['Task 1', 'Task 2']);
  });
});
```

**Phase 5: Deployment & Iteration**

For the deployment phase, you'll need to set up a staging environment and gather feedback from users. Once you've addressed any issues and made improvements based on feedback, you can deploy the tool to production and monitor its usage.

I hope these code snippets and suggestions help you with your Pomodoro time management tool project. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
